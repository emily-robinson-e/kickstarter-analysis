# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Create an analysis of outcomes based on goals and launch date to compare Louises play outcome.

### Purpose
Determine how successful Louise's play was compared to other plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analyzed the success rate of plays based on Launch Dates and Goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes - Launch Date
Based on Launch Date the most successful plays lunched in May and June. The worst month to launch is December.   

### Analysis of Outcomes - Goals
Based on Goals the most successful goals have a range of less than 1000 to 19999 and then again between 35000 to 44999. Anything above 45000 is highly unsuccessful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties experienced.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
Louise should launch in May or June, and she should not launch in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
She should set her Goal from 1000 to 1999 and no higher than 45000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
It does not show the type of play or any qualitative data. You also cannot see the number of backers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Creating a chart showing the number of backers based on Launch Date and Goal will be important for Louise to keep track of her potential success rate.
