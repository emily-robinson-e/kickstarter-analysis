## Analysis and Challenges
Analyzed the success rate of plays based on Launch Dates and Goals

### Analysis of Outcomes
Based on Launch Date The most successful plays lunched in May and June

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties experienced

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
Louise should launch in May or June, and she should not launch in December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
She should set her Goal between 1000 and 1999 and no higher than 45000

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
It does not show the type of play or any qualitative data. You also cannot see the number of backers

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
You could pull in a graph showing number of backers based on goal and launch date.
